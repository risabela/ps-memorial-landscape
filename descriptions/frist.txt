A stone statue of [Joseph Henry](/stories/joseph-henry-and-sam-parker) (1797-1878) is displayed above the main entrance of the Frist Campus Center.  Henry was a leading researcher in the field of electromagnetism, and went on to become the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution after serving as Princeton’s Chair of Natural History from 1832 to 1846.

Sam Parker, a free black man, worked as Henry’s research assistant while he was a professor at Princeton.  Parker obtained materials for Henry’s research, solved technical issues in his laboratory, and was occasionally used as a test subject by students.  Sam Parker’s assistance was so critical that Henry’s experiments completely stopped for a period in 1842 when Parker fell ill.
