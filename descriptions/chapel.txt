Completed in 1928, the Princeton University Chapel is located on the universityâ€™s main campus and serves as a nondenominational chapel for the campus community.  Several architectural features within the chapel are named for Princeton students, presidents, and benefactors who owned slaves, as well as others associated with the college and town of Princeton who opposed slavery.
