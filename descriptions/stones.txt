A wall stone near the south aisle seat of the University Chapel nave is dedicated to Commodore [Robert F. Stockton](/stories/navigating-slavery) (1795-1866).  Stockton was a member of the eminent slaveholding Stockton family of Princeton.  As a United States naval officer, he made a name for himself suppressing the slave trade off the coast of Africa.  In 1822, Stockton was sent to West Africa to acquire the land that would become the [American Colonization Society’s](/stories/princeton-and-the-colonization-movement) colony of Liberia.

A wall stone near the south aisle of the nave is dedicated to Richard Stockton (1730-81).  Stockton was a member of Princeton’s first graduating class in 1748, as well as a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the grandfather of Robert F. Stockton.

A wall stone near the south aisle of the 2nd bay is dedicated to Benjamin Rush (1746-1813), a Founding Father, Enlightenment physician, and graduate of the class of 1760.  Rush was a strong public voice against slavery and the slave trade, although he himself owned an enslaved man named William Grubber.

A wall stone near the south aisle of the 5th bay is dedicated to William Richardson Davie (‘1776), a student of [John Witherspoon](/stories/john-witherspoon).  Davie was one of several College of New Jersey graduates who founded the [University of North Carolina](/stories/princetons-influence-on-southern-higher-education) in 1789, modeling the school’s curriculum and bylaws after Princeton’s.
