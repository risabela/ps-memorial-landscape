The main entrance of the Engineering Quadrangle displays an inscription dedicated to [John Maclean Jr.](/stories/john-maclean-jr-and-princetons-commitment-to-sectional-harmony).  Son of Princeton’s first chemistry professor [John Maclean Sr.](/stories/the-slaves-of-john-maclean-sr), Maclean Jr. was the College of New Jersey’s tenth president and served from 1854 to 1868.

Maclean Jr. did not own slaves during his adult life and personally held antislavery views.  Believing that colonizing free blacks in Africa would induce slave-owners to free their slaves and provide African Americans with an opportunity to escape white prejudice in the United States, Maclean Jr. was a strong supporter of the [American Colonization Society](/stories/princeton-and-the-colonization-movement).  Although popular among white antislavery advocates during the antebellum period, colonization gained little support within African American communities.

Maclean Jr. was also distinguished by his recruitment of southern students and his commitment to making the sons of slave-owners feel comfortable on Princeton’s campus.  From its founding, the College of New Jersey had a larger proportion of [southern students](/stories/student-origins) than any other college in the Northeast—averaging 40% between 1746 and 1865, and often exceeding 50%.  Maclean Jr. likely believed that attracting southern students to Princeton was essential to the viability of the college.  Even during the [Civil War](/stories/princeton-and-the-civil-war), Maclean Jr. encouraged sectional harmony on campus between [proslavery and antislavery students](/stories/the-civil-war-comes-to-princeton-in-1861).
