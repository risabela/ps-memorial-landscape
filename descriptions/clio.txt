The original Clio Hall was built in 1838 and rebuilt and repositioned in 1893.  Clio Hall originally housed the Cliosophic Society; today, it houses the admissions office.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Princeton’s rival literary and debate clubs—[the American Whig Society and the Cliosophic Society](/stories/the-whig-cliosophic-society-and-slavery)—provided students with platforms to discuss controversial issues, frequently slavery and emancipation.  Historically, more [southern-born students](/stories/origins) joined Whig than Clio: between 1819 and 1860, 49% of Whig’s members came from the South (compared to 30% in Clio).  But in debates, members of both societies consistently opposed the emancipation of slaves, serving to foster a conservative, anti-abolition climate on campus.
