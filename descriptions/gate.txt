The wrought-iron Fitzrandolph Gate, the entrance to Princeton’s campus from Nassau Street, was erected in 1905.

The gate was named for Nathaniel FitzRandolph, one of the College of New Jersey’s early benefactors, who donated the 4.5 acres of land on which [Nassau Hall](/stories/fundraising-for-nassau-hall) was built in 1756 and currently stands.  FitzRandolph was a wealthy landowner and slaveholder.  After his death in 1765, a [“Negro man”](sources/negro-man-1) was sold along with FitzRandolph’s 110-acre plantation in Princeton.
