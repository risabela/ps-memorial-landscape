Constructed contemporaneously with Nassau Hall and completed in 1756, the [Maclean House](/stories/presidents-house)—originally called the President’s House—was the official residence of the College of New Jersey’s presidents until 1878.  Of the [first nine presidents](/stories/slaveholding-presidents), all of whom owned slaves, at least five brought enslaved people to campus to live and work at the President’s House between 1756 and 1822.

The house was the site of a slave auction in 1766.  After Princeton president [Samuel Finley’s](/stories/samuel-finley) death, his executors sold his personal property outside the President’s House in August 1766.  The property to be sold included furniture, horses, livestock, Finley’s personal library, and [six enslaved people](/sources/two-women-a-man-and-three-children), listed in a newspaper advertisement as “Two Negro women, a negro man, and three Negro children.”

Other enslaved residents of the house included Caesar, “a Negro Man” whom president [Aaron Burr Sr.](/stories/aaron-burr-sr) purchased in 1755, and [Betsey Stockton](/stories/betsey-stockton) (1798?-1865), an enslaved woman given as a gift to president [Ashbel Green’s](/stories/ashbel-green) first wife.  After her emancipation in 1817, Betsey Stockton became the first single female missionary to the Sandwich Islands (present-day Hawaii) as well as a respected educator and leader in [Princeton’s free black community](/stories/the-witherspoon-jackson-community).
