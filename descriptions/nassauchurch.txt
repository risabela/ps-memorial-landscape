Nassau Presbyterian Church was constructed in 1766 to serve the growing number of [Presbyterians](/stories/presbyterians-and-slavery) among Princeton students, faculty, and residents.  It was originally called the First Presbyterian Church of Nassau Street, with Princeton president [John Witherspoon](/stories/john-witherspoon) named pastor in 1768.

Witherspoon encouraged Princeton’s white religious community to include black congregants, a small number of whom attended services where they were segregated in the balcony of the church.  Both free and enslaved African Americans attended services, and were baptized and married in the church.

 After a first destroyed the original church in 1835, black congregants began meeting for worship separately.  They eventually formed the [First Presbyterian Church of Colour in Princeton](/stories/the-witherspoon-jackson-community) (today’s Witherspoon Presbyterian Street Church).  Church members organized Sunday schools, assisted [fugitive slaves](/stories/runaways), and advocated for voting rights for black Princeton residents.
