Constructed in 1803, Stanhope Hall is Princeton University’s third-oldest building, after [Nassau Hall](/stories/fundraising-for-nassau-hall) and the [Maclean House](/stories/slavery-at-the-presidents-house).  Today it houses the Department of African American Studies.

Stanhope Hall was named for [Samuel Stanhope Smith](/stories/samuel-stanhope-smith) (1795-1812), Princeton’s sixth president.  Smith was an early defender of the unity of mankind—arguing that environment, not innate biological differences, determined a person’s race.  In his 1787 [“Essay on the Causes and Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species”](/sources/an-essay-on-the-causes-of-the-variety-of-complexion-and-figure-in-the-human-species), Smith argued that race was a matter of superficial physical differences, challenging popular ideas of the biological inferiority of African Americans and Native Americans.

Smith himself owned slaves, however, including at least two during his tenure as president.  He was also a strong proponent of the colonization of free blacks, and his teachings influenced several of his students to establish the [American Colonization Society](/stories/princeton-and-the-colonization-movement), an organization which advocated sending free blacks to a colony in Africa.
