The original Dickinson Hall was built in 1869-70, extensively repaired in 1877, and rebuilt after a fire destroyed the structure in 1920.  Today, Dickinson Hall houses Princeton’s Department of History.

The building was named for [Jonathan Dickinson](/stories/jonathan-dickinson) (1688-1747), Princeton’s first president and one of the college’s four original [founders](/stories/founding-trustees).  Dickinson, a Presbyterian minister, was a prominent figure in the Great Awakening of the mid-18th century and preached the spiritual equality of all people, both enslaved and free.  He was himself a slave-owner, however, and purchased a woman named Genny in 1733.  College of New Jersey students may have encountered Genny on a daily basis during the school’s early years, when classes were held at Dickinson’s home in Elizabethtown, New Jersey.
