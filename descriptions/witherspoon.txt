Witherspoon Hall was constructed in 1877 as an undergraduate dormitory.  It was named for [John Witherspoon](/stories/john-witherspoon) (1723-94), United States Founding Father and Princeton’s sixth president.  A member of the Continental Congress and the only active clergyman or college president to sign the Declaration of Independence, Witherspoon was a prominent figure during the American Revolution.

Witherspoon advocated for revolutionary ideals of liberty and personally tutored several free Africans and African Americans in Princeton.  At the same time, he owned slaves on his country estate of Tusculum near Princeton.  He also publicly argued against the emancipation of slaves in his lectures to Princeton students as well as in formal political settings. In 1790, when Witherspoon chaired a committee to advise state leaders on the question of emancipation, he voted against the abolition of [slavery in New Jersey](/stories/legislating-slavery-in-new-jersey).
