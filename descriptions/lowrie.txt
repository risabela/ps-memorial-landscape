Built in 1845, the [Walter Lowrie House](/stories/the-walter-lowrie-house) was originally the home of John P. Stockton, a member of the prominent slaveholding Stockton family.  Stockton, who harbored pro-southern sympathies, was elected to the United States Senate in 1865, immediately following the [Civil War](/stories/princeton-and-the-civil-war).  After Senate Republicans removed Stockton from office on a technicality, New Jersey attempted to revoke the stateâ€™s ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted due process and citizenship to former slaves.
