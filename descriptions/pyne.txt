Constructed in 1922, Pyne Hall is an undergraduate dormitory named for [Moses Taylor Pyne](/stories/moses-taylor-pyne-and-the-sugar-plantations-of-the-americas) (class of 1877).

Pyne was, and remains, one of Princeton’s largest and most prominent benefactors.  In the summer of 1900 alone, Pyne’s contributions to the new library’s collections amounted to nearly fourteen million dollars in modern currency.  While serving as a trustee, Pyne’s donations subsidized Pyne library, two undergraduate dormitories on Nassau Street, faculty and graduate housing, a history seminar, and a professorship.  On the day of his funeral in 1921, Princeton faculty lowered flags to half-mast, suspended classes, and dedicated a tower on campus to “Princeton’s Most Loyal Son.”

Moses Taylor Pyne’s fortune derived from his grandfather Moses Taylor’s successful shipping firm.  From the 1830s through the 1860s, Moses Taylor’s firm was one of the most successful in the global sugar trade—exporting sugar from Caribbean plantations worked by huge numbers of enslaved people.  Upon his death in 1882, Moses Taylor was worth three-quarters of a billion dollars in modern currency.  As his grandfather’s heir, Moses Taylor Pyne used the wealth derived from the 19th century slave economy to transform Princeton into one of the world’s leading universities.
