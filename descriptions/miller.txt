Designed by Charles Steadman and completed in 1834, Miller Chapel is the spiritual center of the [Princeton Theological Seminary] (/stories/Princeton-theological-seminary-and-slavery).  Originally situated on Mercer Street, the chapel was moved to its present location in 1933.  Although the seminary and College of New Jersey were separate institutions, the two often shared faculty and students.

When Princeton undergraduates [apprehended an abolitionist](/stories/attempted-lynching) in town in 1835, they paraded him  in front of the seminary as a warning to antislavery seminarians.  The following year, the college held its annual [commencement](/stories/commencement-addresses) in Miller Chapel.  During the ceremony, Princeton student Thomas Ancrum (class of 1838) [physically assaulted](/stories/white-supremacy-at-commencement) black abolitionist minister Theodore Wright (PTS '1828).
