Dod Hall, built in 1890 as an undergraduate dormitory, was named for [Albert Baldwin Dod](/stories/albert-dod) (1805-45), a Princeton professor and one of the last remaining slaveholders in Princeton.  New Jersey’s [gradual emancipation act](/stories/legislating-slavery-in-new-jersey), passed in 1804, did not fully eliminate slavery in the state until the passage of the 13th Amendment more than sixty years later—allowing slaveholders to continue the practice longer than in virtually any other northern state.  The 1840 Federal Census recorded one female slave living in Dod’s household, one of only twelve slaves in the town of Princeton by that year. 

Dod is also the namesake for an [endowed professorship](/stories/endowed-professorships) at Princeton: the Albert Baldwin Dod Professorship of Mathematics, established in 1869.
