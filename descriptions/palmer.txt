Now a University property, [Palmer House](/stories/the-potter-family-of-prospect-and-palmer-houses) was built in 1823.  James Potter (1793-1862), a wealthy slave-owner with rice plantations along the Savannah River in Georgia, purchased the house from Commodore [Robert F. Stockton](/stories/navigating-slavery) in 1840.  James used the Palmer House as his summer residence while maintaining offices and property in [Georgia](/stories/ princetonians-in-georgia).  James Potter’s father, John Potter, owned nearby [Prospect House](/stories/prospect-farm).

James’s son, John Hamilton Potter (1842-64), spent much of his youth at Palmer House.  He matriculated with the Princeton class of 1863 but left the college in 1861 to fight for the [Confederacy](/stories/princeton-and-the-confederacy) during the Civil War.
