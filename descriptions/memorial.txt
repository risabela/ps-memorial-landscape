Princeton’s [Civil War memorial](/stories/civil-war-memorial), built in the 1920s, is located on the ground floor of Nassau Hall alongside memorials to students and alumni killed in other American wars.  More than 600 Princeton men fought in the [Civil War](/stories/princeton-and-the-civil-war), with more than half of them choosing to fight for the [Confederacy](/stories/princeton-and-the-confederacy).

The stone tablet is inscribed with the names of 70 Civil War dead, listing them alphabetically rather than grouping them by Union or Confederate affiliation—an intentional decision made by President John Grier Hibben in 1920.  This decision reflects the era’s “reconciliationist” politics, which attempted to erase the role of slavery in the Civil War and grant moral equivalency to both the Union and Confederate causes.  Princeton’s Civil War memorial may be the only one in the United States not to indicate which side each man died for.

The tablet’s 70 names include 34 Union and 36 Confederate casualties.  [Recent research](/stories/counting-princetonians-in-the-civil-war) by Princeton archivists has revealed that 86 alumni died in the Civil War, 48 of them for the Confederacy and 38 for the Union.  The current memorial undercounts the total number of casualties, and also includes the names of eight individuals who did not actually serve or die in the war.
