The oldest building on campus, [Nassau Hall](/stories/fundraising-for-nassau-hall) was constructed from 1754-56.  Prior to 1756, classes for the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) were held in Elizabethtown and Newark; after its completion, Nassau Hall was used as both a classroom building and dormitory for students.  Nassau Hall was the site of an American victory during the Revolutionary War and the seat of the Continental Congress in the summer of 1783.

Although no evidence indicates that the building was constructed using slave labor, slave-owners donated a large part of the land for Princeton’s main campus and the money to erect Nassau Hall.  Four of the six largest donors—Thomas Leonard, John Hornor, John Stockton, and Nathaniel FitzRandolph—contributed a total of  £1700 and 211.5 acres of land.  Each of these men built their wealth on farms worked by enslaved people.

Today, Nassau Hall houses the Office of the President and other administrative offices.  The historic Faculty Room—originally used as a library and prayer hall by early students, as well as the meeting-place of the Continental Congress—displays portraits of [Princeton’s presidents](/stories/princetons-slaveholding-presidents).  Each of the first nine presidents of the college (serving from 1746 to 1854) owned slaves during their lives, at least five of them while living at the [President’s House](/stories/slavery-at-the-presidents-house) (now Maclean House) on campus.
