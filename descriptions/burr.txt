Constructed in 1891, Burr Hall was originally called the Chemical Laboratory and housed a lecture hall and two laboratories.  The building was renamed Burr Hall in 1977, in honor of Princeton’s second president, Aaron Burr Sr. (1716-57).

[Aaron Burr Sr.] (/stories/aaron-burr-sr), father of United States Vice President Aaron Burr Jr., was one of the College of New Jersey’s four original [founders](/stories/founding-trustees).  As president, he oversaw the college’s move to [Nassau Hall](/stories/fundraising-for-nassau-hall) as a permanent campus in 1756.  When Burr and his family moved into the [President’s House](/stories/slavery-at-the-presidents-house (now Maclean House) that year, he brought at least one slave: a man named [Caesar](/sources/bill-of-sale-to-aaron-burr-sr), whom he purchased in 1755 for eighty pounds.  By the time of his death, Burr owned at least one other enslaved person, a man named Harry.
