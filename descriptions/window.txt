The South Clerestory Window in the University Chapel’s nave is dedicated to [James Madison](/stories/james-madison) (1751-1836), third President of the United States and Princeton graduate of the class of 1772.  Madison held contradictory views on slavery throughout his life—arguing that slavery was incompatible with Revolutionary principles even as he owned over one hundred slaves on his Virginia plantation and brought enslaved people to the White House as president.
