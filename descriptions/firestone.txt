First opened in 1948, the Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library houses more than seven million books in addition to large manuscript and archival collections.  Firestone Library was named for Harvey Samuel Firestone (1868-1938), founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.  Harvey S. Firestone Jr., his son, was a member of the Princeton class of 1920.

In 1926, the Firestone Company established a rubber plantation in the west African Republic of Liberia.  At the time, the company was the largest employer in Liberia and faced accusations that labor conditions on the plantation were comparable to slavery.

Liberia was founded in 1822 by the [American Colonization Society](/stories/princeton-and-the-colonization-movement), an organization dedicated to colonizing free blacks in Africa in order to remove them from the United States.  The ACS was established in 1816 by Princeton alumni Charles Mercer (class of 1797), Elias B. Caldwell (‘1796) and Robert Finley (‘1787), and received support from Princeton presidents, faculty, and alumni throughout the 19th century.  [John Maclean Jr.](/stories/john-maclean-jr), Princeton’s tenth president, was a particularly prominent advocate for the ACS.
