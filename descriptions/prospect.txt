Present-day Prospect House was built in 1851 by [John Potter](/stories/the-potter-family-of-prospect-and-palmer-houses), a wealthy slave-owner with rice plantations in [Georgia](/stories/princetonians-in-georgia) and [South Carolina](/stories/princeton-and-south-carolina).  The stone mansion stands on land that comprised the [Prospect](/stories/prospect-farm) estate, a farm worked by enslaved people during the 18th and early 19th centuries.

United States Agent for Indian Affairs George Morgan purchased Prospect in 1779.  Morgan boarded Princeton students at his house, including his adopted Leni Lenape son [George Morgan White Eyes](/stories/indians-slavery-and-princeton) (class of 1789).  In 1780, when an enslaved man named [Michael Hoy](/stories/runaways) attempted to run away from Prospect Farm, George Morgan advertised a $500 reward for his capture.  John Craig, who purchased the property from Morgan in 1804, may also have used slave labor on the farm.
